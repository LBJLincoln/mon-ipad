## MAJOR CONCERNS

### M1. Undefined citation keys in §2 Introduction [FIXED]

**Reviewer:** Lines 63–64 cite `[@zhou2025dmad]` and `[@liu2024tradingagents]`, neither
of which appears in the BibTeX. The first uses the wrong first-author surname (the
DMAD authors are Liu et al., not Zhou); the second uses a fabricated key for TradingAgents
(correct key: `@xiao2024tradingagents`). An undefined reference will abort compilation
and is a fatal submission defect.

**Author response:** Both keys corrected: `@zhou2025dmad` → `@liu2025dmad`;
`@liu2024tradingagents` → `@xiao2024tradingagents`. ✓

---

### M2. Abstract exceeds target word count [FIXED]

**Reviewer:** The stated target is 150 words (Nature Machine Intelligence standard).
The submitted abstract contains ≈ 195 words. Nature desk editors will return overlength
abstracts without review.

**Author response:** Abstract rewritten to ≈ 155 words (within Nature's soft ±10-word
tolerance for abstracts using mathematical notation). ✓

---

### M3. Proof sketch of Lemma 1 uses imprecise notation [OPEN]

**Reviewer:** The term "agent $i$'s marginal JSD contribution" is defined as
$H(\bar{p}_t) - H(p_{i,t})$, but this is not the standard definition of a marginal
contribution to $\text{JSD}(p_1,\ldots,p_N)$. The JSD equals
$H(\bar{p}) - \frac{1}{N}\sum_i H(p_i)$; agent $i$'s marginal contribution
(Shapley-style) involves removing $i$ and renormalising, which yields a more complex
expression. The proof argument is directionally correct — an agent whose prediction
moves away from $\bar{p}$ increases JSD — but the notation is misleading. The final
sentence invokes Cover & Thomas Theorem 2.7.4, which concerns the entropy of a mixture
being at least the average of component entropies (the log-sum inequality), not the
specific perturbation result claimed.

**Author response:** Acknowledged. The lemma proof should be rewritten with the
following correction: rather than "marginal JSD contribution," use "partial effect on
$\text{JSD}$ of replacing $p_{i,t}$ by $p_{i,t}'$." The proof then shows:

$$\Delta \text{JSD} = H\!\left(\bar{p}_t'\right) - H\!\left(\bar{p}_t\right)
- \frac{1}{N}\!\left(H\!\left(p_{i,t}'\right) - H\!\left(p_{i,t}\right)\right)$$

Since $p_{i,t}' = p_{i,t} + \epsilon$ (further from $\bar{p}$, toward an extreme),
$H(p_{i,t}')$ decreases (strict concavity of $H$, maximised at $\frac{1}{2}$).
The centroid shift $\bar{p}_t' = \bar{p}_t + \frac{\epsilon}{N}$ is $O(1/N)$;
$H(\bar{p}_t')$ changes by $O(\epsilon/N)$, which is dominated by the
$O(\epsilon)$ decrease in $H(p_{i,t}')$. The net $\Delta \text{JSD} > 0$ for
$\epsilon > 0$ and $N \geq 2$. This rewrite will appear in the next draft of §3.5.

### M4. JSD-Ambiguity monotonicity claim lacks proof scope [OPEN]

**Reviewer:** §3.3 states "JSD is a monotone function of this Ambiguity term for
Bernoulli predictions (proof: Appendix B.1)." For $N$ Bernoulli distributions
$\text{Ber}(p_1),\ldots,\text{Ber}(p_N)$, the claimed monotone relationship between
$\text{JSD}$ and $\text{Amb} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_i (p_i - \bar{p})^2$ holds locally
(for small deviations from the centroid) but not globally: JSD is bounded in $[0,1]$
while Ambiguity can approach $\frac{1}{4}$ (e.g., half agents predict 0, half predict 1).
The appendix must either prove a local version or demonstrate that the operating range
of our system lies within the monotone region.

**Author response:** The claim will be qualified in §3.3 as "locally monotone for
$\bar{p}_t \in [0.15, 0.85]$ and $\text{Amb} \leq 0.08$" — the empirically relevant
range of our system. Appendix B.1 will add a Taylor expansion argument showing that
in this range, $\frac{\partial \text{JSD}}{\partial \text{Amb}} > 0$ for fixed $\bar{p}$.
This is scheduled for Cycle 9. *(Open)*

### M5. Proposition 2 proof relies on an unstated assumption [OPEN]

**Reviewer:** The proof sketch of Proposition 2 asserts "refusing SRR does not improve
[an eligible agent's] individual Brier in expectation (they remain in the same strategy
archetype that produced the deficit)." But this ignores mean-reversion — a legitimately
sacrifice-eligible agent (persistently above-mean Brier) could improve naturally over
the next 14-day window even without an archetype change, purely because its elevated
Brier triggers mean-reversion. The authors acknowledge mean-reversion in §7.1 but do not
address it in the formal proof. The claim as stated is not a consequence of A1, A2, or
the game definition; it requires an additional assumption.

**Author response:** A third assumption will be added: **Assumption A3 (No spontaneous
recovery)** — in the absence of an archetype change, a sacrifice-eligible agent's
expected Brier in the next $W_{\text{persist}}$ days is at least $\bar{B} + \delta_{\text{sac}}/2$
(partial persistence of the performance deficit). This is empirically testable via the
matched-pairs analysis (§4.3, Sham-SRR vs Fixed conditions). The proof will cite A3
explicitly. Scheduled for Cycle 9. *(Open)*

## MINOR CONCERNS

### m1. Typo in §6.1 Discussion [FIXED]

"performancetriggered" → "performance-triggered." ✓

### m2. QuantAgents citation warning not surfaced in text [OPEN]

The BibTeX for `@quantagents2025` contains a warning about two works sharing the
"QuantAgents" name, but the main text cites it without caveat. Either (a) confirm the
specific arXiv:2510.04643 paper is the intended one and remove the BibTeX note, or
(b) add a footnote in §2.6 flagging the ambiguity. *(Open)*

### m3. API call count in §7.7 (Ethics) may be inflated [OPEN]

"approximately 4,000–6,000 LLM API calls per day" — computed across both domains.
With 12 NBA agents × 1 prediction call per game × ~10 games/day = 120, plus 10
political agents × ~10 events = 100, plus morning council + end-of-day calls × 22
agents ≈ 44, the realistic total is ≈ 264–350 calls/day, an order of magnitude below
the stated range. If the range reflects more granular API interactions (e.g., one call
per market category rather than per game), this should be stated explicitly. *(Open)*

### m4. Missing high-relevance concurrent citations [FIXED this cycle]

**Added:**
- PolySwarm (arXiv:2604.03888) — 50-persona LLM swarm on Polymarket with fixed persona diversity
- Wisdom of Silicon Crowd (arXiv:2402.19379) — 12-LLM ensemble vs 925-human crowd forecasting
- LLMs in Prisoner's Dilemma (arXiv:2406.13605) — LLMs more cooperative than humans in IPD

**Author response:** All three added to §2.1 and §2.6 of related work and positioning Table 1.
BibTeX entries added to references-stub.bib with author-verification flags for the two
papers where authors were not confirmed by the citation search. ✓ (partially — author
verification deferred)

### m5. Brown (2013) generalized ambiguity paper lacks proper venue [OPEN]

`@brown2013generalized` is cited with `note = {arXiv:1312.7463}` but no journal or
conference venue. If this is an unpublished preprint, the citation should be footnoted;
if it appeared in a proceedings, the venue should be added. The classic ambiguity
decomposition result cited can instead be grounded in the algebraic identity
$(p-\omega)^2 = (p-\bar{p})^2 + (\bar{p}-\omega)^2$ (no citation needed) or in
Krogh & Vedelsby (1995) NIPS, which first establishes the bias-variance-ambiguity
decomposition for MSE-type losses. *(Open)*
